Thank you for checking out my mod!

This mod contains:

An in game help screen
A custom HUD and menu
Continuously spawning enemies
Weapon replacements
A single boss
5 different items that alter your character
5 different characters to try out.

This is a roguelike game, there is no win-condition, the goal is to see how long you can survive. There is nothing carried over between games, you start every run with no items and 1 weapon. Every character is unique and every run is different.

Game Instructions (Also available in the Mod Help page on the main menu):

Characters:
Selecting a character affects your speed, health, armor and weapons.
Commando is a basic, all-around average character. Uses a blaster.
Huntress is an fast, strong-scaling character but has lower health and armor. Uses an automatic bow.
Railgunner is an average character with a slow firing railgun that deals massive damage.
Mercenary is a fast katana-wielding character that scales well.
Mul-T is a slow, tanky character with strong damage. Uses a nailgun.

Gameplay:
When you start a game, use the prompt you pick your class. The enemies begin spawning right away, and you must fight to survive. They come endlessly in random waves spawning around the map, and in 4 enemy types. Every now and then a boss will spawn in, and you must kill it. All enemies have a chance to drop items, which augment your characters stats. Some enemies have higher chances to drop items than others, and bosses always drop an item.

Items:
Bison Steak: Killing enemies rewards health (+1 for every stack)
AP Rounds: Higher damage
Soldiers Syringe: Higher Attack Speed
Topaz Brooch: Killing enemies generates armor (+1 for every stack)
Spring Boots: Jump higher and take less fall damage
